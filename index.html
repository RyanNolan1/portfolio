            Hi I'm Ryan,
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been working as a Production Manager for the past 9 years and
            have decided to make a career change into software development as I
            enjoy being creative and problem solving. Currently, I am working
            part-time while building projects and applying for jobs.

          <p id="description">
            After making the decision to leave my previous job I enrolled on a
            coding bootcamp with Northcoders, Manchester. Northcoders is an
            intensive coding bootcamp that offers a full-time, 13-week course in
            software development. During the course, I learnt a range of
            programming languages, tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, and Git.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the technical skills I learnt, I also developed a
            range of other skills that are valued by employers. For example, I
            learnt how to work collaboratively as part of a team, pair
            programming, how to communicate effectively with colleagues and
            clients, and how to manage my time and workload effectively.
            <br />
            <br />
            After graduating the course I feel that I gained a strong foundation
            in software development, which has given me the confidence to create
            my own projects which I will be documenting on this portfolio.

            This is a rock paper scissors game I made for The Odin Project.
            <br />
            <br />
            I thought this would be quite straight forward but there was a few
            head scratching moments, mainly with getting the correct scores to
            display at the right times. I also learnt how to use audio tags and
            custom fonts.

          <p id="description">
            This is a rework of the original fuel price comparison app I made. I
            was happy with the original app at the time but I'd mainly focused
            on the app's appearance and hadn't paid too much attention to the
            efficiency / readability of code. I decided to build it again with
            everything I had learnt, here are the key improvements I made:
            <br />
            <br />
            - The API is only called once, on the previous app the API was
            called every time a button was clicked. This worked but wasn't very
            efficient so now the API is called and then the data is filtered
            locally.
            <br />
            <br />
            - To minimise the amount of repeated code, I reduced the JavaScript
            from 275 lines to 103, and the CSS from 331 lines to 156.
            <br />
            <br />
            - I used array methods instead of for loops to make the code more
            readable and easier to understand.
            <br />
            <br />
            - To improve security, I stored the API key in an .env file and
            accessed it using Express and Cors middleware in a Node.js server. I
            then made a fetch request to the server to retrieve the API key.
            <br />
            <br />
            - I built the app mobile-first, which made it simpler to create a
            responsive design that worked well on desktops as well as mobile
            devices.

          <p id="description">
            This is the first project I have built after graduating from
            Northcoders, a fuel price comparison app that lets you search by
            fuel type and then sort by distance and price. I remember attempting
            this 5 months ago and struggling to even get a console log from the
            API so I'm really happy with the progress I've made. The languages
            used are HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            <br />
            <br />
            I had a lot of fun building this app and learnt a lot from the
            issues that I ran into in the process such as:
            <br />
            <br />
            - Discovering after at least an hour that the API trial key wont
            work for post codes that don't include an "A" so my code was working
            perfectly but I wasn't using the correct post code ðŸ˜…
            <br />
            <br />
            - Somehow creating a weird loop that went through the 1000 requests
            a day limit and locked me out for 24 hours so I couldn't carry on
            working on it for a day, very frustrating.
            <br />
            <br />
            - Spending hours and hours with CSS / Flexbox trying to get things
            to display properly on all devices.

            During the last 2 weeks of the Software Development bootcamp, I
            worked in a team of four to create our app "Barber Shop". Barber
            Shop is a booking system which allows users to browse their
            available hair appointments as well as book and pay for their
            appointments through the app. Users can also login in to view
            previous and upcoming appointments.
            <br />
            <br />
            The main thing I learnt when creating the app was how to effectively
            work as a team as we had a stand up each morning, worked in pairs
            and kept in contact constantly to discuss the progress of the app

          <p id="description">
            The first project I developed was a project called NC Games, which
            is a board game review app. It allows users to view, comment on, and
            upvote/downvote board game reviews. The project consisted of two
            parts: front end and back end development.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the back end, I created an API to access application data to be
            displayed on the front end. I used node-postgres to interact with a
            PSQL database. This allowed me to efficiently manage and store user
            data.
            <br />
            <br />
            The front end section involved displaying the data with React, and
            making the page responsive for different view ports. By using
            responsive design techniques, I ensured that the app was accessible
            on multiple devices, making it easy for users to engage with the
            content.
